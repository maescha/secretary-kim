Hello! Welcome to *Secretary Kim*'s repository.

Secretary Kim is a simple [Discord](https://discord.com/) Bot meant to meet the most basic of server/channel needs. 

Secretary Kim is a project meant to test my Javascript skills and has been something I've worked on since October 2020. It is not complete but I plan to continue working on adding more commands.

Secretary Kim's duties include the following...
- pinning a message to the server
- engaging the user in a simple ping-pong exchange
- making a simple agree/disagree poll using :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown:
- returning the name of the server

A full list of the commands this bot is capable of can be returned after calling **!help** once installed. 

## How To Run
**In order to run** *Secretary Kim* **, the developer must create a separate `config.json` file and create an object with the following:**
- `"prefix": "!"`,
- `"token": [YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN]`
